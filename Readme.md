# plandoplando

This a mod for loading planned randomizers with Hollow Knight. 

It requires both SereCore and ItemChanger installed, in order to run. 

- To start a plando, go to the Mods folder containing plandoplando.dll. 
- Create a folder named "Plando", if it does not already exist. 
- You will need a file named "plando.xml" containing the changes of the plando you want to play. 
- Place this file in the Plando folder, and start the game. 
- If mods are not correctly installed, or the plando requests invalid changes, you may get a "FAILED TO LOAD" error where the mod version is displayed. 
- If no xml was placed at the filepath, you will get an "XML NOT FOUND" error at the mod version. 
- If everything loads correctly, the version will display the title of the plando, or "TITLE NOT FOUND" if no title was set by the author.
